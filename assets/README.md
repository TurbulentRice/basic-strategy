# Assets Directory

This directory contains app assets such as images, icons, and fonts.

## Required Assets

The following placeholder files need to be replaced with actual assets:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

## Temporary Placeholders

For now, we'll generate simple placeholders. These should be replaced with proper designed assets before release.

## Future Assets

- Card images (optional - can use Unicode symbols initially)
- Custom fonts (if needed)
- Sound effects (optional)
