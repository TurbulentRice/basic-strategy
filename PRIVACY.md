Basic Strategy ("the App") is designed to work without collecting personal data.

## Data Collection

We do **not** collect, store, or sell personal data through the App.

The App does not require account creation and does not request personal identifiers such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.

## Analytics and Tracking

The App does **not** use third-party analytics SDKs or ad tracking SDKs.

## Advertising

The App does **not** serve ads.

## In-App Data

Practice stats and progress are stored locally on your device for app functionality.

## Data Sharing

Because we do not collect personal data, we do not share personal data with third parties.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is a general-audience educational app and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

No app backend account system is used for personal data in this version. Data used by the App is local to the device.
